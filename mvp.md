Step 1: Define the Core MVP Features

You don’t need everything at once. Decide what’s in your MVP:

User auth (signup, login, subscription/payment).

Connect social media accounts (start with 1–2 platforms, e.g., Twitter/X + Instagram).

Fetch & store analytics data (followers, engagement, impressions).

Dashboard to visualize metrics (charts, tables).

Export reports (PDF/CSV, optional for MVP).
